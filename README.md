This project will be a replication of Birks, Daniel, and Davies, Toby (2017). "Street network structure and crime risk: An agent-based investigation of the encounter and enclosure hypotheses", Criminology, 55(4): 900-937. 

Birks and Davies (2017) use netlogo software to create their virtual world. I will use R, igraph, and data from Geoff Boeing's repository, here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/F5UNSK. Web links occasionally disappear. Thus, here is the full reference of the article where Boeing describes his dataset: Boeing, G. (2019). Street Network Models and Measures for Every U.S. City, County, Urbanized Area, Census Tract, and Zillow-Defined Neighborhood. Urban Science, 3(1). http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci3010028.
